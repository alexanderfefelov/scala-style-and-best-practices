# Scala Style and Best Practices

    With over 1000 contributors, Apache Spark is to the best of our knowledge the largest open-source project in Big Data and the most active project written in Scala. This guide draws from our experience coaching and working with engineers contributing to Spark as well as our Databricks engineering team.

    Code is written once by its author, but read and modified multiple times by lots of other engineers. As most bugs actually come from future modification of the code, we need to optimize our codebase for long-term, global readability and maintainability. The best way to achieve this is to write simple code.

    Scala is an incredibly powerful language that is capable of many paradigms. We have found that the following guidelines work well for us on projects with high velocity. Depending on the needs of your team, your mileage might vary.

    I often find myself, both professionaly and otherwise, having to explain bits of Scala to newcomers to the language (but usually not new to programming).

    Something that’s becoming increasingly obvious is that Scala developers follow a certain set of unspoken rules without really thinking about them, and never really explain them to beginners. This is not helping Scala’s reputation as a hard to learn language, which is unfortunate - it’s a language I enjoy and wish more people would learn.

    This site is meant to address that, by listing and explaining all these rules I wish someone’d told me about when I was learning the language.

    Comments, suggestions, … are welcome! I’m clearly not the best Scala developer out there and might have gotten things wrong, or right for the wrong reasons. If you see areas that could be improved on, feel free to open an issue!
